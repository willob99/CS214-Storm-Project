# CS214-Storm-Project

### VariableInstancesTopology.java
Put VariableInstancesTopology.java in examples/storm-starter/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/starter/.
Fill in the baseDir variable in two places so the topology can write its output to a file.
Before you submit the topology, and every time you change it, run `mvn package` in examples/storm-starter/.

### storm-adjuster.py
This can go anywhere. Fill in the path variables in the file to point to the right places.
Then you should be able to run python storm-adjuster.py to run Storm locally for 60 seconds.
